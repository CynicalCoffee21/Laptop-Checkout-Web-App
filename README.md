"# Laptop-CheckOut-Web-App" 

A web application that used SQL, PHP, Javascript/JQuery, HTML, and CSS to allow a user to check in/out laptops and log the relevant data.

A web application that allows a user to select from a set of laptops, and enter some information for a database. Then the laptop is considered checked out, and a similar process can be followed to check in. There is some auto-fill, modal, and bootstrap functionality. The admin/intervalReports pages allow an admin to draw up various reports on the checkouts across set time intervals. The project implements PHP, MySQL, Javascript/JQuery, HTML, and CSS.

I included an SQL file that contains the exported database that I used for this system, which runs on localhost and has no set Username and password.
